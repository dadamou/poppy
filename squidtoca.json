We&rsquo;ve grown from two people with a big idea to a pretty huge team with limitless ambition (in fact, we kind of need a bigger office&hellip;).</p><p><br></p><p>Everything we make has the same objective, to capture the power of play and to celebrate the diversity and quirky things that we love in the everyday. We design from a kid&rsquo;s perspective, always testing with them first and learning from what they show us. They give us ideas, and sometimes they draw us pictures too.</p><p><br></p><p>We&rsquo;re proud to have grown a business that prioritizes inclusivity, open-mindedness, and playing with stuff. Our focus is never on winning, or doing something &lsquo;right&rsquo;, we provide a playground that only really comes alive when kids bring their magic along &ndash; it&rsquo;s why we make games rooted in play.</p><p><br></p><p>Imagination has always been our most important ingredient. We need it to come up with ideas, and kids need it to play &ndash; there&rsquo;s pretty much nothing a bit of imagination can&rsquo;t improve. In ten years, it hasn&rsquo;t failed us yet.</p>",
