Step on the gas while ascending a steep track. Steep tracks make it almost impossible for your vehicle to move up and pressing and holding the accelerator will make the ride much smoother. It will increase your vehicle&rsquo;s speed. Before doing anything else, upgrade your vehicle&rsquo;s (Speed). This will make it easier for you to ascend steep tracks and you will be using less fuel.</p><p><br></p><p>You may also have to press the gas pedal to tilt the vehicle in mid-air so that it lands safely on the track.

        "guide": "A Hot Wheels monster truck is at maximum risk of crashing when it’s launched high up in the air. While it’s the best time to do these flips, chances of landing on its back and exploding are also more. Many times, your car will “nose dive” into the track and then flip and explode when it hits the ground on its back. When its nose dives and is close to the race track, tap the gas pedal to tilt up your vehicle so that it lands on all 4 wheels. When your vehicle is tilted backward, tap the brakes pedal to tilt it forward so that it does not land on its back. Your taps depend on how close your vehicle is to the race track. Just make sure you don’t press and hold any of the two buttons for too long.",

        "guide": "<p>The stunt&apos;s chest is available every 24 hours. When the chest becomes available, you will have to fill the chest bar to open it. The stunts chest bar can be seen just beside the fuel bar. Perform special moves to fill the bar faster and earn rewards. You can get 1000 coins on opening the chest. Here are some basic stunts you can try out to fill the chest bar faster:</p><p><br></p><p>Wheelie: This can be performed by driving on two wheels, where the front end wheels are lifted up and the rear wheels stay on the track. A &ldquo;Wheelie&rdquo; is triggered when your truck keeps moving in this position for a few seconds.</p><p><br></p><p>Endo: This is just the opposite of wheelie. Your vehicle&rsquo;s rear wheels are tilted up and the front end stays grounded. It&rsquo;s triggered when your vehicle keeps moving in this position.</p><p><br></p><p>Big Air: Probably the easiest &ldquo;stunt&rdquo;, Big Air can be performed by just jumping high up in the air. Big Air and Wheelie are the two most easy-to-pull-off stunts and you will be performing them quite often, without needing to do anything special with those two buttons at the left and right side of the screen.</p><p><br></p><p>Back Flips: To perform a backflip, your vehicle should be launched high up in the air. When in mid-air, press and hold the gas pedal to tilt your vehicle up and perform a full 360-degree backflip. You can also do the front flip high up in the air by pressing and holding the brake pedal on the left side of the screen to make your truck tilt forward and perform a full 360-degree front flip. Don&rsquo;t overdo backflips/front flips. You can easily perform at least one backflip when your vehicle launches high up in the air.</p>",

        "guide": "<p>It is one of the most common problems in the android operating system. Usually, when you open an app, you will see a black screen for a few seconds and then the app will crash with or without an error message. There are a few ways to fix this problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the time, it might be a temporary loading issue. You just need to press the recent applications menu (usually the first left button) on your phone. Then you close the app that has this issue. Now open the app again. It may work normally.</p><p>Try a Hard reboot on your Android mobile. Press and hold down the &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Power&quot; buttons at the same time for up to 10 seconds. Then, release the buttons and hold down the &quot;Power&quot; button until the screen turns on. Now you can try opening the app, it may work fine.</p><p>If none of the above workings, you can wait till your phone battery drains and it turns off automatically. After that put it to charge, and press the power button. It may work after this.</p><p>Finally, if you can&apos;t fix it with anything, you may need to uninstall the app and re-install it. Android usually restores all settings after you re-install and log into the app. You can see if that fixes it.</p><p>Even in some rare cases, the re-install step also doesn&apos;t work. If that is your case, try installing older versions of the app. Good luck!</p>",
