Look at the fuel bar at the top of the screen and you will know how quickly the bar decreases when you step on the gas for some time. Try to save as much fuel as possible until you spot a gas refill on your way to the finish line.</p><p><br></p><p>Don&rsquo;t just press the gas pedal every time. Step on the gas while ascending a steep track. Steep tracks make it almost impossible for your vehicle to move up and pressing and holding the accelerator will make the ride much smoother. It will increase your vehicle&rsquo;s speed. Before doing anything else, upgrade your vehicle&rsquo;s (Speed). This will make it easier for you to ascend steep tracks and you will be using less fuel.</p><p><br></p><p>You may also have to press the gas pedal to tilt the vehicle in mid-air so that it lands safely on the track. Light taps on the gas pedal will make it possible for a safe landing in case your vehicle is nose-diving into the track.</p>",

        "guide": "A Hot Wheels monster truck is at maximum risk of crashing when it’s launched high up in the air. While it’s the best time to do these flips, chances of landing on its back and exploding are also more. Many times, your car will “nose dive” into the track and then flip and explode when it hits the ground on its back. When its nose dives and is close to the race track, tap the gas pedal to tilt up your vehicle so that it lands on all 4 wheels. When your vehicle is tilted backward, tap the brakes pedal to tilt it forward so that it does not land on its back. Your taps depend on how close your vehicle is to the race track. Just make sure you don’t press and hold any of the two buttons for too long.",
